# A R Enterprises Vapi

This repository contains a website built for A R Enterprises, a cleaning products manufacturer in Vapi, India, using Nuxt.js. Nuxt.js is a Vue.js framework for building universal Vue applications. Universal Vue applications can be rendered on the server, which makes them faster and more SEO-friendly than traditional client-side rendered Vue applications.

The A R Enterprises website is a simple but effective website that showcases the company's products and services. The website features a homepage with a brief overview of the company, a products page with detailed information about the company's cleaning products, and a contact page where visitors can get in touch with the company.
